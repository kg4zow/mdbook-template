# Introduction

This is a newly created "book" using [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), with the customizations I normally use:

* Horizontal bars of varying thickness above `H1`, `H2`, and `H3` headers. (Example below.)

    I find this makes it easier to quickly spot the beginnings of the sections when the lines are used as separators between the sections. I also think it makes more sense to have the bars *above* the section headers instead of below them.

* Automatic git commit and version information at the bottom of the navigation panel on the left.

* A `Makefile` with rules to publish the HTML and other files that make up the book, either to a web server or to GitHub Pages.
