# Introduction

This is a newly created "book" using [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), with the necessary customizations to support an automatic version block at the bottom of the navigation bar on the left.

This repo can be used as a "template" for new books. The only real "content" is in the `introduction.md` file, which you are reading right now. The procedure I use for starting new books from this template is explained in the repo's `README.md` file.
