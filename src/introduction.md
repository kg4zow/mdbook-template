# Introduction

This is a newly created "book" using [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), with the customizations I normally use:

* Horizontal bars *above* `H1`, `H2`, and `H3` headers. (I think having bars above the section headers makes more sense than below the headers.)

* Automatic version block at the bottom of the navigation bar on the left.

* A `Makefile` with rules to publish the HTML and other files that make up the book, either to a web server or to GitHub Pages. You will almost certainly need to edit this file.
