# `mdbook-template`

Last updated 2022-06-03

This repo contains a template that I use when creating new "books" using [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), so I don't have to manually copy and edit a bunch of files. It contains an empty "book" generated by mdbook, with the following customizations:

* Horizontal bars of varying thickness above `H1`, `H2`, and `H3` headers. I find this makes it easier to quickly spot the beginnings of the sections when the lines are used as separators between the sections. I also think it makes more sense to have the bars *above* the section headers instead of below them.

* Automatic git commit and version information at the bottom of the navigation panel on the left.

* A `Makefile` with rules to publish the HTML and other files that make up the book, either to a web server or to GitHub Pages.

[`https://kg4zow.github.io/mdbook-template/`](https://kg4zow.github.io/mdbook-template/) contains the output generated from this repo, as published by "`make gh-pages`" in the `Makefile`.

# TL;DR

### Start a new book using this repo as a template

Clone the template repo.

```
$ cd ~/git/
$ git clone https://github.com/kg4zow/mdbook-template newbook
$ cd newbook/
```

&#x26A0;&#xFE0F; **REMOVE THE `.git/` DIRECTORY**, so the directory on your workstation isn't "linked" to my git repository.

```
$ rm -rf .git/
```

Remove or edit the following files as needed:

* `book.toml`
* `LICENSE.txt` - see [`choosealicense.com`](https://choosealicense.com/) if needed
* `README.md`
* `src/introduction.md`

```
$ nano book.toml
$ rm LICENSE.txt
$ nano README.md
$ sed -i -e '2,$d' src/introduction.md
```

If the generated HTML files are going to be hosted on a web server, or in GitHub Pages, edit `Makefile` and un-comment the appropriate line(s), as explained in the file itself.

```
$ nano Makefile
```

If your text editor creates "temp files" which need to *not* be added to the repo, update the `.gitignore` file as needed.

```
$ nano .gitignore
```

### Initialize a new git repo

Also create and tag the initial commit.

```
$ git init -b main
$ git add .
$ git commit
$ git tag initial
```

### GitHub Pages

**IF** you plan to publish your book using GitHub Pages, run the `setup-gh-pages` script. This will create a `gh-pages` branch with a *totally separate commit history* from the `main` branch.

```
$ bash setup-gh-pages
```

> &#x26A0;&#xFE0F; The script requires `git` version 2.0.7 or later.

Once you've done this, or decided that you don't need to do it, you can remove the script from your repo.

```
$ git rm setup-gh-pages
$ git commit -m 'Removed setup-gh-pages script'
```

### Create a GitHub repo and push the new repo to it.

```
$ gh repo create --public kg4zow/newbook
$ cd ~/git/newbook/
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:kg4zow/newbook
$ git push --all -u
$ git push --tags
```

If you're publishing to GitHub Pages, be aware that it might take a minute or two before the page is published.

### Work on the book's content

In window 1 ...

```
$ cd ~/git/newbook/
$ make serve
```

In window 2 ...

```
$ cd ~/git/newbook/
$ bbedit .
```

### Commit changes and push upstream

```
$ git add .
$ git commit
$ git push
```

### Publish HTML

Make sure the "`push:`" target in `Makefile` is correct, then ...

```
$ make push
```

# Background

This section will explain the customizations I'm making to how `mdbook` formats its output.

## Section Lines

### What are "Section Lines"?

If you're looking at the generated HTML version of this file, you will notice horizontal lines of different thickness above some of the section headers. The three section headers above this paragraph will have the three "sizes" of lines.

&#x26A0;&#xFE0F; Note that these lines will only show up in the HTML that `mdbook` generates. If you're looking at a Markdown file using the GitHub web interface, you'll see GitHub's "Section Lines", which are different (i.e. only for `H1` and `H2`, with `H1`/`H2` lines being the same thickness, and with the lines *below* the section header text). GitHub does not allow any kind of custom stylesheets within their web pages, for security reasons.

### Why?

I do this because it makes it easier for me to tell where each logical section of the document starts, and I think it makes more sense to have the lines *above* the section header text rather than *below* it.

### How?

This is done using two files:

* **`section-lines.css`** - contains the CSS declarations which add the lines to the HTML.

    The CSS customizes the appearance of HTML `H1`, `H2`, and `H3` elements, *other than* the first `H1` on the page. (I don't add the heavy bar to the first `H1` because I use the same CSS when generating PDF files, I normally use an `H1` header for the document title, and there was no need for that extra heavy bar across the top of the first page.)

* **`book.toml`** - tells `mdbook` how to generate the book. The following line tells `mdbook`, when it generates HTML output, to include the following CSS files in addition to the ones included in the theme.

    ```toml
    [output.html]
    additional-css  = [ "section-lines.css" , "version-commit.css" ]
    ```

    This example has a second file in the `additional-css` list. This other file is used by the Automatic Git Commit Information feature, which is explained below.

## Automatic Git Commit Information

If you're looking at the generated HTML from this repo, you will notice at the bottom of the navigation bar on the left, a block containing a "Version". This information is the git commit from which the HTML was generated. This is not something that `mdbook` does on its own, I had to figure out how to make it happen.

**I am not the first person to figure out how to do this.** There are several other web pages out there explaining how to do more or less the same thing, and I *did* read through a few of them to get ideas. The pages I found all seemed to want to add the version information at the bottom of each page, but I wanted the information to be at the bottom of the navigation bar, so I ended up having to do a lot of trial and error and figure out parts of it myself.

I'm a firm believer in giving credit where credit is due, however while I was figuring this out, I didn't think I would end up writing my own documentation about it, so I didn't keep a list of the pages I was looking at - or if I did, they're in a file on a different computer. If I happen to find those links in the future, I will update this document to give credit where credit is due.

The way I'm doing it involves the following files, in this repo.

### `version-commit`

This is a script which does two things:

1. Reads a stream of data provided by `mdbook`, and prints part of it out.

    When `mdbook` runs a filter, it sends that script a JSON list with two elements. The first element will contain information about the overall "book", and the second element will contain information about the "chapters", or pages, which make up the book. This includes the contents of the input Markdown files.

    Filtering scripts are expected to output a *possibly modified* copy of *just the second element* from the JSON structure. If the script happens to modify the JSON, it changes the "input" that `mdbook` processes, and thereby modifies the generated HTML pages.

    In our case, we aren't modifying anything about the Markdown input itself. We're only writing a "filter" because it's the only "hook" that `mdbook` provides to run user-supplied scripts before building the HTML pages.

    Because we aren't modifying the input, the script just prints the second element as-is.

2. Reads the "`theme/index-template.hbs`" file, substitutes a few values related to the state of the git working directory, and writes a new "`theme/index.hbs`" file.

    Specifically, the script substitutes values for the following tags:

    * `@VERSION_COMMIT_HASH@` - the output from "`git describe --always --tags --dirty`", which includes the most recent tag and how many commits "ahead" of that tag we are, the commit hash (if it's different from the tag), and whether or not the content is "dirty" (i.e. if the working directory contains content which hasn't been committed yet).

    * `@VERSION_COMMIT_TIME@` - the timestamp of that commit.

    * `@VERSION_COMMIT_NOW@` - the timestamp when the script was executed by `mdbook`.

    All other content from the "`the/index-template.hbs`" file is copied as-is to the "`theme/index.hbs`" file.

### `version-commit.css`

Contains CSS to control the formatting of the items being added to the template.

In my case I wanted the text to be a bit smaller than the normal text in the Table of Contents, so [the file I use](./version-commit.css) contains some simple directives to set the text size and line spacing. I like the way it looks, obviously you're free to customize it any way you like.

### `theme/index-template.hbs`

This is a *copy* of the `index.hbs` file from the default theme built into `mdbook`, with the appropriate lines added to make the version information appear where and how I wanted it.

To get this file, use your copy of `mdbook` to create a dummy book with the full set of theme files, and copy the `theme/index.hbs` file from there.

* Create a dummy book with the theme files, by running "`mdbook init --theme`" in an empty directory.

    ```
    $ mkdir ~/work/xyz
    $ cd ~/work/xyz
    $ mdbook init --theme --ignore none -title x
    ```

* Copy `theme/index.hbs` from this dummy book, to somewhere outside the directory. Give your copy the name "`index-template.hbs`".

    ```
    $ cd ~/work/xyz/
    $ cp theme/index.hbs ~/index-template.hbs
    ```

* You can delete the dummy book now if you like.

    ```
    $ cd
    $ rm -rf ~/work/xyz/
    ```

* Edit your copy of the file, and search for "`toc`". You should find it within a "`<nav>`" element that looks like this:

    ```html
            <nav id="sidebar" class="sidebar" aria-label="Table of contents">
                <div class="sidebar-scrollbox">
                    {{#toc}}{{/toc}}
                </div>
                <div id="sidebar-resize-handle" class="sidebar-resize-handle"></div>
            </nav>
    ```

* Just after the `{{/toc}}` tag, add the new content shown below. Everything between the two "`<!--`" lines is being added, and nothing outside of those two lines is being changed or deleted.

    ```html
            <nav id="sidebar" class="sidebar" aria-label="Table of contents">
                <div class="sidebar-scrollbox">
                    {{#toc}}{{/toc}}
    <!-- The @VERSION_COMMIT_XXX@ tags below will be replaced with specific values
         by the 'version-commit' script, every time 'mdbook' rebuilds the HTML. -->
                    <hr/><div class="part-title">Version</div>
                    <div id="commit" class='version-commit-div'>
                        <span class='version-commit-hash'><tt>@VERSION_COMMIT_HASH@</tt></span><br/>
                        <span class='version-commit-time'><tt>@VERSION_COMMIT_TIME@</tt></span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="part-title">Generated</div>
                    <div id="generated" class='version-commit-div'>
                        <span class='version-commit-now'><tt>@VERSION_COMMIT_NOW@</tt></span>
                    </div>
    <!-- End of @VERSION_COMMIT_XXX@ stuff -->
                </div>
                <div id="sidebar-resize-handle" class="sidebar-resize-handle"></div>
            </nav>
    ```

* Save the result as `theme/index-template.hbs` within your new book.

Note that you can also get the original `index.hbs` file from [the `mdbook` source code](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/blob/master/src/theme/index.hbs).

> &#x1F6D1; **Be sure to use the file matching the version of `mdbook` that you're running.**
>
> As an example, the `index.hbs` file from `v0.4.15` was updated in `v0.4.16`. The change had something to do with how the "`mdbook serve`" auto-reload functionality works. As a result, books using an `index-template.hbs` file from `v0.4.15` won't automatically reload if you're using `mdbook v0.4.16` or later.

### `book.toml`

The `[preprocessor.version-commit]` section in the `book.toml` file tells `mdbook` to run the `version-commit` file before generating the HTML output.

```toml
[preprocessor.version-commit]
renderers       = [ "html" ]
command         = "./version-commit"
```

* If you want to change how the git commit information is formatted within the pages, edit `theme/index-template.hbs`.

* If you want to change how the "version" or the timestamps are presented (i.e. to use a different `git` command to get the commit info, or to format the timestamps differently), edit the `version-commit` script.

    It's written in Perl, however it's very *simple* Perl, and if you're familiar with other scripting languages (i.e. shell, Python, Ruby, etc.) you should be able to understand it, even if you aren't familiar with Perl itself.

This file also contains a declaration which makes the `version-commit.css` file be included as part of the HTML files.

```toml
[output.html]
additional-css  = [ "section-lines.css" , "version-commit.css" ]
```

This example has a second file in the `additional-css` list. This other file is used by the Section Lines feature, which is explained above.

# Pre-requisites

The following items need to be installed on the machine where you're going to be working. Note that the instructions below are meant for macOS and Linux. I don't use ms-windows, if you're stuck with it my only suggestion is to use "WSL" and treat it as a Linux machine.

This is a quick list of what's required, I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about these.

### `mdbook`

Obviously.

* **macOS**: (using Homebrew) run "`brew install mdbook`".

* **Others**: [This page](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html) explains how to install `mdbook`.

### `git`

Also obviously.

* **macOS**: The `git` program is included as part of the XCode Command Line Tools. macOS comes with a `git` "stub" that will walk you though installing the XCode Command Line Tools if they aren't already installed.

    You can also install `git` using Homebrew if you like, however you may need to check your `PATH` to be sure that Homebrew's binaries are seen *before* the `/usr/bin/` directory.

* **Others**: See the [Installing Git page](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) in the official `git` documentation.

### Perl and the JSON module

The `version-commit` script is written in Perl, and uses the JSON module to parse the data stream it receives from `mdbook`.

Perl itself is generally installed as part of the operating system, or available from the OS vendor's package repositories (i.e. `yum`, `apt`, etc.) On macOS, Perl is already installed.

The Perl JSON module contains code for Perl scripts to work with JSON files. Some operating systems may install this automatically as part of Perl itself -- if you run "`perldoc JSON`" and it shows you documentation, it's already installed.

* **macOS**: Perl is installed by the OS, run "`cpan install JSON`" to install the JSON module.

* **CentOS 7**: run "`yum install perl perl-JSON`" as root.

* **Debian 10 and 11**: Perl is installed by the OS, run "`apt install libjson-perl`" as root to install the JSON module.

* **Arch Linux**: run "`pacman -S perl perl-json`" as root.

# Starting a new book from this repo

As mentioned above, you can also use this repo as the starting point for a new book. It already has these customizations in place, all you'll need to do is delete the documentation you're reading right now and start new pages.

* Clone this repo into a new directory.

    ```
    $ cd ~/git/
    $ git clone https://github.com/kg4zow/mdbook-template newbook
    ```

* Remove the `.git/` directory, which contains the commit history from the template repo. We will be starting a brand new git repository for *your* book below.

    ```
    $ cd ~/git/newbook/
    $ rm -rf .git/
    $ git init
    ```

* Remove the `README.md` and `LICENSE.txt` files.

* If you're planning to host the resulting HTML pages on a web server somewhere, edit `Makefile` and update the `push` target with whatever commands will copy the `book/` directory (where `mdbook` stores the generated HTML files) to the appropriate server and directory.

* If your text editor creates "temp files" of any kind, you should update the `.gitignore` file so these files aren't accidentally committed into the repo. Common filename patterns for this include "`*.bak`", "`*.swp`", and "`*~`". I normally work on macOS so the file already includes "`._*`" and "`.DS_Store`".

    You will also notice that the `.gitignore` file includes a few other entries...

    * **`/book/`** - this excludes the `book/` directory where `mdbook` writes the generated HTML files. If the "`mdbook init`" command creates a `.gitignore` file, it writes "`book`" in the file. The difference is, "`book`" by itself would exclude any file or directory anywhere in the repo with the name "book", but "`/book/`" only excludes a directory called "book", in the root of the repo.

    * **`/theme/index.hbs`** - this file is *generated* by the `version-commit` script when the HTML is generated. For the purposes of your repo it should be thought of as a "temp" file, and not stored in the git repo.

* Initialize a new git repo in the current directory, and commit the files.

    ```
    $ git init -b main
    $ git add .
    $ git commit
    ```

    > &#x2139;&#xFE0F; With older versions of `git`, the "`git init`" command didn't support the "`-b`" option to set the initial branch name. If the command fails with an error message like "`error: unknown switch 'b'`", you can run "`git init`" followed by "`git branch -m main`" instead.
    >
    > Obviously, if you want the repo's primary branch to be something other than `main`, you can adjust the commands accordingly.

* I normally add a tag called "`initial`" on the very first commit in every new repo. (This is also not required, but I find it makes life easier in the future.)

    ```
    # git tag initial
    ```

At this point, the local repo should be ready. If you're planning to store the repo in GitHub or some other server, you should create an empty repo there and push the contents. As an example, this is what I did to create the template repo on GitHub and push the initial commit and tag.

```
$ gh repo create --public kg4zow/mdbook-template
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:kg4zow/mdbook-template
$ git push -u origin main
$ git push --tags
```

# Working on your book

My normal workflow looks like this:

```
$ cd ~/git/newbook/
$ git fetch -p
$ git checkout main
$ git pull
$ bbedit .
$ make serve
```

> &#x2139;&#xFE0F; I always start with "`git fetch -p`", "`git checkout main`", and "`git pull`" because I use several different computers to work on things, and running these commands before I start ensures that I'm starting from whatever I last pushed from any other machines.

The "`make serve`" command runs "`mdbook serve --open --hostname 127.0.0.1`". This does a few things:

* Generates the HTML files for your book.
* Starts up a web server, listening on `127.0.0.1:3000`.
* Opens a browser window pointing to `127.0.0.0:3000`.
* Watches the files in the book's directory. If it detects any changes to a file containing (or controlling) the book's content, it re-generates the HTML and signals the browser window to refresh itself.

This lets you see a "live preview" of what the finished product is going to look like, while you're working on the content.

When you're finished working on the book for now, hit CONTROL-C to exit from "`mdbook serve`", and then commit your changes.

```
$ git commit -a
```

If the book's repo is stored on a remote service (like GitHub), push the changes.

```
$ git push
```

If the generated HTML is being hosted on a web site somewhere, and you've updated `Makefile` so it knows how to upload the new content, push the HTML files to the web server.

```
$ make push
```
